            or <strong>"donggua"</strong> in Chinese</em>). If you don't know what winter melon is or can't find it in a

            swelling,

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>

        </li>

        <ul>

            <li>While the ribs are blanching, boil a kettle of hot water</li>
            <li>Once the water with the ribs comes to a boil, drain the ribs and rinse them with the hot water to remove
                blood and impurities</li>
            <img src="../images/pork-rib-water-boils.jpg" width="150">
        </ul>

        <li>
            <h3>Peel and cut the winter melon</h3>
        </li>

        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the blanched ribs, winter cubes, and enough water into the inner pot of the pressure cooker.
                <strong>No
                    need to put any seasoning</strong>. Close the lid and cook on high pressure for about <strong>25-30
                    minutes</strong>
            </li>
            <p><em>Ps. A pressure cooker is great for pork rib soup because it makes the meat soft, juicy, and
                    delicious.</em>
