    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Korea noodle soup is easy to make. Basicly you put a pack of Korean noodle in a pot of boiled water together with
        the seasoning bags that come with it. That's it. You make it!</p>
    <p>To make it more nutritious, put in eggs, vegetable and any kind of meat you like.</p>
    <p>There is <mark>no strict recipe</mark> to follow. <strong>Make it as you wish! You decide your own
            recipe!</strong></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>Here are the ingredients I usally use to make my own Korean noodle soup(but as I've said, no strict recipe. You
        can always <strong>freestyle with your own ingredients</strong>!):

    <p>You can also put meat in. Here are the meat which I like to put in:
    <ul>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Hot dog sussage</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>I usually make my korean noddle like this:
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the tomatoes, spring onions, bacon, hot dog sussage or any other ingredients you'd like to put into
            small dices</li>
        <li>Boil a kettle of water(about 500ml) so you have boiled water to be aside</li>
        <li>Heat up the wok, put a tea spoon of olive oil in and fry 1 egg</li>
        <li>When the egg is fried into a fixed shape, put the chopped ingredients. Stir fry them while the fried egg is
            aside</li>
        <li>Pour the boied into the wok until the water covers all the ingredients and the water level is about one
            finger tip above</li>
        <li>Crack another egg in and let it boil in the water for </li>
        <li>Open the korean noodle pack, put the noodle and the seasoning bags in. If the water can't cover the noodle,
            put more hot water in.</li>
        <li>Boil everything for 3 to 5 min</li>
        <li>Put some sesame oil in before you get everything in the bowl. It will taste and smell even better!</li>
        <li>That's it. Go enjoy it and make sure eat slowly and safe as the noodle soup can be very hot!</li>
    </ol>
